I am fascinated by the world of data science, especially deep learning. I am easily distracted by beautiful data visualisations.

I currently work for [AppNexus](http://www.appnexus.com) as a Client Insights Analyst.

As part of my work, I am fortunate to be able to lead development on AppNexus' partnership with the [Federation for Internet Alert](www.internetalerts.org), building and maintaining the [Global Alert Hub](https://www.internetalerts.org/hub/messaging), which aims to utilise the scale, reach and speed of modern programmatic internet advertising to deliver timely and targeted critical safety alerts to the public.
