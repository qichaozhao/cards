I am fascinated by the world of data science, especially deep learning and reinforcement learning. I am easily distracted by beautiful data visualisations.

I currently work for LinkedIn China as a Senior Data Scientist.

I was fortunate to have been able to lead development on [AppNexus'](http://www.appnexus.com) partnership with the [Federation for Internet Alerts](www.internetalerts.org), building and maintaining the [Global Alert Hub](https://www.internetalerts.org/hub/messaging), which aims to utilise the scale, reach and speed of modern programmatic internet advertising to deliver timely and targeted critical safety alerts to the public.
